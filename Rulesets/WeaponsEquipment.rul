      STR_AMMUNITION: AMMUNITION
      STR_9MM_PISTOL_X10: "9mm Pistol Rounds (x10)"
      STR_9MM_PISTOL_X10_UFOPEDIA: "The 9mm caliber ammunition is a popular small, lightweight projectile used by pistols from WW2. This magazine contains 10 bullets and is mainly used in pistols, although a soldier can take the bullets out to fill other magazines."
      STR_9MM_PISTOL_X20: "9mm Pistol Rounds (x20)"
      STR_9MM_PISTOL_X20_UFOPEDIA: "Due to its ease of construction and weight, it is easy to supply a large quantity of 9mm calibre bullets to the troops. It has little recoil, but also little stopping power. This magazine carries 20 useful projectiles."
      STR_9MM_PISTOL_X30: "9mm Pistol Rounds (x30)"
      STR_9MM_PISTOL_X30_UFOPEDIA: "Thanks to the controllability of firing a 9mm calibre weapon in automatic mode, many sub-machine guns use this cartridge. The 30 bullet magazine allows a large quantity of ammunition to be transported without greatly increasing the weight of the magazine, especially useful in weapons with high fire rates."
      STR_45_PISTOL_X7: ".45 ACP Pistol Rounds (x7)"
      STR_45_PISTOL_X7_UFOPEDIA: "The .45 caliber ACP ammunition was invented by J. M. Browning in 1905 for the famous M1911 pistol. Its introduction was due to the fact that smaller calibers of revolvers had difficulty in taking down an enemy in one shot. This magazine allows 7 bullets to be loaded and is used only on the M1911 handgun."
      STR_45_PISTOL_X30: ".45 ACP Pistol Rounds (x30)"
      STR_45_PISTOL_X30_UFOPEDIA: "Very appreciated by its stopping power, it has been used on numerous firearms, such as pistols and sub-machine guns. However, due to its power and size, bullets of this caliber are more expensive and heavier than other pistol calibers, such as the 9mm Parabellum. This magazine can carry 30 useful rounds and can be used in sub-machine guns."
      STR_5_56MM_NATO_RIFLE_X20: "5.56mm NATO Rifle Rounds (x20)"
      STR_5_56MM_NATO_RIFLE_X20_UFOPEDIA: "The intermediate cartridge 5.56x45mm NATO was born as a response to the experiments of ArmaLite (creators of the AR-15/M-16 family) with smaller, faster and lighter projectiles than the 7.62mm NATO. It is derived from the civilian .223 Remington cartridge, being similar in performance. This 20-rds magazine is used in NATO assault weapons. "
      STR_5_56MM_NATO_RIFLE_X30: "5.56mm NATO Rifle Rounds (x30)"
      STR_5_56MM_NATO_RIFLE_X30_UFOPEDIA: "This 30-rds magazine for the 5.56mm NATO is an experiment. During the Vietnam war some units had them, some units had but didn't use them (because unreliable). For example MAC/SOG purchased them on the civilian market, but the had very few. Usually a SOG member on operations had only one 30 rounds mag (inserted in the weapon) and the rest was composed of the standard 20-rds mags. Our engineers can manufacture them at the workshop (and we can even sell them, are quite profitable)"
      STR_7_62MM_NATO_RIFLE_X5: "7.62mm NATO Rifle Rounds (x5)"
      STR_7_62MM_NATO_RIFLE_X5_UFOPEDIA: "Defined by NATO since 1950 as the Organization's standard firearms cartridge, the 7.62x51mm ammunition is a heavy projectile, used in battle rifles, precision and machine guns of all types. It is appreciated for its armor-penetrating power. This magazine holds 5 bullets and its used only on the PSG-1 Sniper Rifle."
      STR_7_62MM_NATO_RIFLE_X20: "7.62mm NATO Rifle Rounds (x20)"
      STR_7_62MM_NATO_RIFLE_X20_UFOPEDIA: "Although it has been replaced to some extent by the 5.56x45mm intermediate cartridge developed for the AR-15 rifle, it was decided that it would still be used in various battle rifles, one of the most famous being the Belgian FN FAL rifle. This magazine has a capacity of 20 bullets and is the most commonly used."
      STR_7_62MM_NATO_RIFLE_X30: "7.62mm NATO Rifle Rounds (x30)"
      STR_7_62MM_NATO_RIFLE_X30_UFOPEDIA: "The firepower provided by this caliber limits its use in weapons with automatic fire, but becomes much more controllable in its use in weapons with long, heavy barrels. This particular magazine is not widely used, mostly on LMGs and some modified weapons. This is because it is heavier than the 20-bullet one, although it can be used without major problems with the same guns chambered in 7.62x51mm."
      STR_7_62MM_NATO_LMG_X50: "7.62mm NATO LMG Rounds (x50)"
      STR_7_62MM_NATO_LMG_X50_UFOPEDIA: "The 7.62mm ammunition used in light machine guns is mounted on the popular M13, a metallic disintegrating link specifically designed for ammunition belt-fed firearms. This configuration allows more ammunition to be transported in a more compact manner."
      STR_7_62MM_NATO_LMG_X100: "7.62mm NATO LMG Rounds (x100)"
